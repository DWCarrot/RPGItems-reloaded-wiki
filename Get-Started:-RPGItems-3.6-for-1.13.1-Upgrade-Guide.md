## Update From v3.5

0. Stop the server
1. Download RPGItems 3.6 and its dependencies: NyaaCore, Vault, LangUtils, put them to your plugins directory, and remove old version of them. Leave RPGItems directory on here.
2. Do other upgrades and update your Spigot to latest 1.13.1
3. Start the server
4. Monitor the console and see your upgrade progress
5. Profit!

The upgrade is automatic and should change any behavior of items (except those with PowerCommand -- as vanilla minecraft break them and PowerColor -- not done yet). If you come across any stacktrace or misbehavior of items, feel free to open an issue here. Server ops will be notified when any item upgrade fails when they login.
